<p>

The software quality in this repo is non existent, it was the fastest way to organize a project that we could finish in one day (yes one day)  

if there was more time:  

- i'd utilize interfaces to have every other event-type inherit our i-event.ts interface  
- i'd only have one card component class to generate the list of event card results  
- i'd only have one component for the pages linked in the side bar. the title only changes, so we can take advantage of activated route or pass a variable of the title text. many better solutions  
- i can skip mentioniong "actually using a database" & having an Api project, ofc we can continously make this list longer.  
- but from the code thats exisiting, thats how i would architect things to improve the software quality.
